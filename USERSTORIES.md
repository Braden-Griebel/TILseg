1. Bob is a graduate student who wants to create translation biotechnology, specifically cancer diagnostic tools. Bob wants to adapt this software to cluster immune cells in multiplexed immunofluorescent images instead of H&E-stained images. Bob is technically advanced, and he is looking for detailed software. 

2. Robert is a clinical pathologist. He would like to use this software to reduce variance in diagnosis between him and his colleagues such that his patients are more likely to receive a consistent diagnosis. Robert is well versed in anticipated results of an image, but he is not technologically advanced. Therefore, he prefers a simple interface.

3. Alice works at an imaging company as a software developer. She is looking to develop new software that works with their instrument to automate image segmentation of HE images. She hopes the existing software will provide the framework for segmentation, such that her main focus is integrating this tool into the instrument.
